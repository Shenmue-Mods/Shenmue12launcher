Note that no claim is being made to any of the original assets, hence the lack of a license. The original image icons are copyright Sega and included to preserve the same experience provided by the unmodified launcher. This deriviative work requires the user to own a copy of the original game on Steam to function; it requires game data to run and will not work outside of the game directory.
